Sentiment Classifier ðŸŽ­

A deep learningâ€“based sentiment analysis model that classifies  text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiments.

ðŸ“‹ Overview

This Sentiment Classifier analyzes social media posts, reviews, or comments and predicts their sentiment polarity.
The model has been trained and evaluated on a labeled  dataset containing diverse expressions, slang, and social text patterns.

âœ¨ Features

ðŸ§  Trained on real-world social media and review data

ðŸ”  Custom preprocessing pipeline (tokenization, normalization, stopword removal)

ðŸ¤– Built with PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers

ðŸ“Š Achieves strong performance on sentiment benchmarks (Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, Recall)

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

ðŸš€ How It Works

Data Preprocessing:
Cleans text by removing punctuation, normalizing characters, and tokenizing using SentencePiece.

Model Training:
Fine-tunes a Transformer model (e.g., BERT-based or custom LSTM) on labeled  sentiment data.

Evaluation:
Uses accuracy, F1, and confusion matrices to evaluate sentiment classification.
